## 📋 Overview

AVR (Agent Voice Response) is a comprehensive platform that bridges the gap between traditional telephony systems and modern AI capabilities. At its core, AVR manages real-time voice communication between callers and AI-powered conversational agents through Asterisk's AudioSocket protocol.

### Core Components

AVR orchestrates five key AI services to create seamless voice conversations:

1. **🎤 ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**: Converts incoming audio streams into accurate text transcriptions
2. **🧠 LLM (Large Language Model)**: Processes text input and generates intelligent, context-aware responses  
3. **🔊 TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: Transforms AI-generated text into natural-sounding speech
4. **📝 STT (Speech-to-Text)**: Alternative transcription service for providers without native ASR support
5. **🗣️ STS (Speech-to-Speech)**: Direct voice-to-voice AI communication for ultra-low latency interactions

### Why AVR?

- **🔌 Universal Compatibility**: Works with any ASR, LLM, or TTS provider via standard HTTP APIs
- **🏢 Enterprise Ready**: Seamlessly integrates with existing Asterisk, FreePBX, VitalPBX, and Vicidial systems  
- **💰 Cost Effective**: Mix and match providers to optimize costs and performance
- **🚀 Rapid Deployment**: Docker-based architecture for quick setup and scaling
- **🛡️ Production Grade**: Built for reliability with comprehensive error handling and monitoring

## 🏗️ Architecture

AVR follows a modular, microservices architecture that enables flexible deployment and easy scaling.

### Traditional Flow (ASR + LLM + TTS)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Caller] --> B[Asterisk PBX]
    B --> C[AVR Core]
    C --> D[ASR Service]
    D --> E[LLM Service]
    E --> F[TTS Service]
    F --> C
    C --> B
    B --> A
```

**Step-by-step process:**
1. **📞 Call Initiation**: Customer dials extension, Asterisk answers and generates UUID
2. **🔗 AudioSocket Connection**: Asterisk establishes TCP connection with AVR Core
3. **🎤 Speech Recognition**: AVR Core streams audio to ASR service for real-time transcription
4. **🧠 AI Processing**: Transcribed text sent to LLM service for intelligent response generation
5. **🔊 Voice Synthesis**: AI response converted to speech via TTS service
6. **📢 Audio Playback**: Synthesized voice streamed back to caller through Asterisk

### Modern Flow (Speech-to-Speech)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Caller] --> B[Asterisk PBX]
    B --> C[AVR Core]
    C --> D[STS Service]
    D --> C
    C --> B
    B --> A
```

**Ultra-low latency process:**
1. **📞 Direct Connection**: Customer connects via Asterisk AudioSocket
2. **🗣️ Real-time Processing**: Audio directly processed by STS service (OpenAI Realtime, Ultravox, etc.)
3. **⚡ Instant Response**: AI-generated speech immediately streamed back to caller
